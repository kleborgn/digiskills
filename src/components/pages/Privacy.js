                <div className="content">
                    <p>When doing any online transaction you can take steps to protect your personal information. Use the same common sense as you would when asked for personal information on paper or face to face. Ask yourself:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>who is collecting the information</li>
                        <li>what will be done with it?</li>
                        <li>is it necessary?</li>
                        <li>what are the consequences for me?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Check a site’s privacy notice to find out what it intends to do with your information. A privacy notice, sometimes called a privacy policy or statement, should tell you who is collecting your information, what it is going to be used for, and whether it will be shared with other organisations. This information may also be provided at the time you are asked for personal data via a popup box or floating text.<br/><br/>
                    If the intentions are not clear, ask the company concerned for further details before you give any personal data, especially if it is sensitive. Companies may want to use your personal information to send you marketing or pass your details to other companies for marketing. They should give you the chance to opt in or out of receiving this marketing.<br/><br/>
                    Be careful when providing your personal information online. In particular, do not make too much personal information available to lots of people, for example by having open access on social networking sites. Your personal information can be used to steal your identity and commit fraud. Be wary of anyone who asks for your bank or credit card details, and only use secure sites when shopping online – secure sites usually carry the green padlock symbol in the address bar. However, this on its own is not a guarantee that you’re visiting the site you think you are – make sure the address for the website is the one you would expect as well.<br/><br/>
                    Be careful when providing your:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full name</li>
                        <li>Full address</li>
                        <li>Date of birth</li>
                        <li>Telephone number</li>
                        <li>National insurance number</li>
                        <li>School/ workplace</li>
                        <li>Birthplace</li>
                        <li>Previous addresses</li>
                        <li>Bank account details or payment card details</li>

                <div className="content">
                    <h3>1 - Use proper language</h3>
                    <p>Never type in all caps, try to avoid slang word as much as possible, mixed up sentences reflect on you, correct spelling and grammatical construction are a must</p>
                    <h3>2 - Be precise</h3>
                    <p>Being misunderstood is quite common in online interactions; escape the miscommunication trap by double checking that what appears perfectly clear to you is not confusing your readers. </p>
                    <h3>3 - Justify your opinion</h3>
                    <p>If you have several points you want to develop, prefer to post them individually in more than one focused messages, rather than in a long, overly wordy paragraph. Keep in mind that you need to contribute to the online discussion, so remember to always justify your points of view.</p>
                    <h3>4 - Tone down your language</h3>
                    <p>Because written language lacks the support of facial or voice communication clues, it can be easily misinterpreted. A great way to deal with this is to tone down your language; avoid the use of strong words and, again, read aloud everything you want to post before you send it.</p>
                    <h3>5 - Recognize and respect diversity</h3>
                    <p>When you're on the internet, you're talking to the whole world and therefore there are multiple cultures, so you have to respect the whole world, don't use abusive language</p>

                <div className="content">
                    <p>For several years now, several companies and researchers have realised that digital technology has a serious impact on people's physical, emotional, mental and social health. Digital technology impacts all aspects of our well-being, positively or negatively depending on how we use it. <br />
                    Some information on average :
                    <ul>
                        <li>We look at our phone every 12 minutes</li>
                        <li>65% of people play on their phone/tablet to relax at home</li>
                        <li>We spend 25 hours a week on social media</li>
                        <li>46% of us couldn't live without our phones</li>
                        <li>4 billion people, half the world's population, have access to the internet</li>
                    </ul>
                        To reduce this addiction here are some tips: <br /><br />
                        -   Leave the phone and tablet out of the bedroom. This practice really works, my screen is no longer the last thing I look at before going to sleep nor the first thing I see when I wake up, a real joy. <br />
                        -   Turn off all notifications (yes, yes, all of them!). Try it, it's worth it, even if it takes a while to turn them off as you have to do it one by one. Start with the most intrusive ones, namely Netflix, Spotify, Amazon and Kindle. <br/>
                        -   Set your phone to black and white. <br />
                        -   Take breaks if you work from home <br />
                    </p>
