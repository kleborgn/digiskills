                    <p>To create or edit the right document format, it is imperative to choose the right application, for example to edit .odt you need to use OpenOffice, .pdf with adobe acrobate or .pptx with PowerPoint, if you have a file with an extension that you don't know don't hesitate to go and look on the internet like on openfileextension.com

                <div className="content">
                    <p>If you want to create or edit media you can use basic software on your computer such as :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Voice Recorder</li>
                            <li> Camera</li>
                            <li>Paint</li>
                        </ul>
                        to do basic things, if you want to take things further there are more complex and complete software on the internet for editing or recording
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className="title_parts">
                    C) Processing numerical data
                </div>
                <div className="content">
                   <p>Later on, you may have to send data over the internet that is more or less heavy, so it will be essential to compress your work so that it is lighter when sent and therefore faster to send. <br />
I propose you Winrar which is a shareware and 7zip which is a free software. These are the two main compression software that are easy to use.</p>
